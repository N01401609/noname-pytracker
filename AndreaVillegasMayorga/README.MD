**Task Status**

* Wireframes still need to be translated from paper to invision

**Problems encountered and how was it resolved**
 
 * A big problem that I found during the starting learning process of python was learning it with and withough Django. When I first started I did not do the set up of the code correctly as I was only using plain python. As I dived into more and more tutorials I found myself more aware of the use of django. 
 * When working starting to work on the ERD diagrams, not having the full picture of all the tables my other team members were creating was challenging as I was not fully sure how my feature database wise was going to be driven. As we combined our ERD it became clearer how the features worked off each other.
